    <description>A Mod that adds items I thought should be in the game.

Currently only adds one item to test how this whole process works.

That item also happens to be a bag of D**ks as a joke so use if you have humor.
The bag of d**ks is a food that counts as a fine meal with a mood buff of +7 but is as cheap as a simple meal to make.

Also adds a Plate of D**ks that counts as a lavish meal.
